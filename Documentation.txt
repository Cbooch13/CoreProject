I ran test.py which used various test files from the data folder
in order to test my code

The TokenList class wraps around the Tokenizer class in order for
easier use

All grammar symbol files have a parse, print, and execute

The interpreter class contains my tokenList, which is an array of
tokens that I gave every symbol class access to

The main file creates the tokenList, as well as the program
object to be parsed, printed, and executed
